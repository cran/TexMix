#' @title Polygon layer of Dallas County, TX, census tracts
#' @description Census tracts in Dallas County, Texas, in the longitude and
#'   latitude format (see \code{proj4string=CRS("+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84")}).
#'
#'   \strong{Attention}: Two census tracts do not have a night time population and therefore
#'   NA's in most of their variables. These tracts are the airports of Love Field  and DFW
#'   (see \code{tractShp$TRACT=="48113980000" | tractShp$TRACT=="48113980100"}).
#' @docType data
#' @name tractShp
#' @source Based on 2018 ACS data, which were retrieved from Maptitude
#' (\url{https://www.caliper.com/}). The store density statistics by census
#' tract were calculated by the authors.
